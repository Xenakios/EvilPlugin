# EvilPlugin

JUCE-based audio plugin that does all kinds of things plugins are not supposed to be doing, 
such as crashing, locking up and using lots of CPU. It could be useful for amusement purposes or
for testing things like hosts that can host plugins in external processes to see how they handle the 
out-of-process plugins doing crazy things.
